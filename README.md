                                          Multi-Modal Semantic Search Engine with RAG : 
This project implements a multi-modal semantic search engine using Langchain or LlamaIndex. It retrieves and ranks text chunks and images from a source document based on a user query. it also extends functionality to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to generate natural language responses.

Goals
*Multi-Modal Search: Retrieve and rank relevant text chunks (500-1000 characters) and images based on user queries.
*Optional RAG Enhancement: Generate answers using a text generation model (e.g., BART) based on retrieved content.
*Technologies:
-Langchain or LlamaIndex
-Transformers (for optional text generation)
-CLIP (for embeddings)
-PyTorch
